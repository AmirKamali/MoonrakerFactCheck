# Truth Whisperer
## Inspiration
In today's fast-paced world, misinformation can spread just as quickly as legitimate news. Our inspiration for creating this app was to provide a tool that empowers individuals to verify the facts in spoken content on-the-fly. Whether it's a speech, a podcast, or an everyday conversation, our app aims to bring clarity and truth to the forefront.

## What it does
This app allows users to record audio directly or upload pre-recorded audio files. Once the audio is captured, it's transcribed using advanced speech recognition technology. The transcribed text is then fact-checked in real-time against verified data sources through a multi-agent system, utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. This system not only checks facts but also provides users with references and sources, allowing them to explore the context and details behind each fact check.

## How we built it
We built the app using a combination of speech recognition APIs for audio transcription and a robust backend architecture featuring the RAG model for dynamic information retrieval and fact-checking. The backend is supported by a multi-agent system that interacts with various external APIs and databases to retrieve the most accurate and up-to-date information. The frontend was developed in a user-friendly manner, making it easy for anyone to record and verify information seamlessly.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the accuracy and speed of the transcription and fact-checking processes. Integrating the RAG model with our multi-agent system required significant fine-tuning to balance performance and precision. Additionally, handling diverse accents and dialects in audio recordings posed a substantial challenge in maintaining consistent transcription accuracy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are particularly proud of the seamless integration of complex technologies such as speech recognition and the RAG model into a user-friendly app. Our system not only provides quick fact-checking results but also maintains a high level of accuracy, which is crucial for building trust with our users.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained a deeper understanding of natural language processing and machine learning technologies. We also learned about the challenges of designing an intuitive UI/UX that simplifies complex processes. The importance of having a robust backend capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously without compromising on speed or accuracy was another key takeaway.

What's next for Truth Whisperer
Looking forward, we aim to expand the database of sources for fact-checking to cover more subjects and languages. We also plan to enhance the AI's ability to understand context better, which will improve the accuracy of both transcription and fact-checking. Additionally, we are exploring partnerships with educational institutions and media outlets to further the reach and impact of our app.
